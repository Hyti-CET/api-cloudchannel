How to use Cloud Channel API

## Pre-requisites

### Google WorkSpace User and Role
To API request WORKS a user from Google WorkSpace Domain need to have the Resales permission.


In our case we have created a Google Workspace Custom Function with Resalles read permission. And after it you need to assign this role to Google Workspace user.
